# Pics-to-PDF
takes a bunch of pics in a folder and pastes them to a libre office document and exports them to a pdf

If you compile it to an exe file it is very likely that you will find that antiviruses treat it like a trojan since it can access your keyboard

will run fine in a shell though

I do not know how to make it current user so as of right now it has my base directory as well as the location of the repo on my computer as venv look ups and default things

While otherwise good, LibreOffice writer is utter crap at pasting pictures, especially lots of pics at the same time.
I went ahead and added the export as pdf part too

This program will:

ask for directory with pictures

ask for what name to give the output file

(assuming you have a blank LibreOffice writer doument open and click to it after prompts)

will paste all pictures in order of appearance in the folder

export it all as a pdf
